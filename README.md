# zsh-test-runner (ztr) ![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/olets/zsh-test-runner)

> Straight-forward tests and coverage reports for zsh and â€”under zsh's emulationâ€” csh, ksh, and sh

**What it features**: everything you need for testing zsh scripts.

-   test [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) and, to a degree, [csh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_shell), [ksh](http://kornshell.com/), and [sh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell) thanks to zsh's [`emulate`](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Shell-Builtin-Commands.html) builtin
    -   optionally give tests descriptive names and additional notes
-   run one or more tests on the command line
-   run one or more tests saved in a test suite file
-   optionally run a setup function before each test
-   optionally run a teardown function after each test
-   skip tests
-   queue tests to run in a batch
    -   optionally run a bootstrap function before each batch
    -   optionally run a clean function after each batch
-   access cumulative failure, pass, and skip counts as shell variables
-   print coverage summaries with total count, failure count and rate, pass count and rate, and skip count
-   short and gentle learning curve

**What it does not feature**: its own human language-like declarative test syntax.

There's no "describe", "expect", etc. Downside is the tests don't read like a story. Upside is â€”because the shell already has rich support for testsâ€” there is nothing idiomatic to learn, there are no artificial limits on what can be tested, the cost to migrating to zsh-test-runner (or from it, if you must) is very low, and there is no risk that assertions were incorrectly implemented. Just write your `[[ ]]`s, `(( ))`s, even your `test`s and `[ ]`s.
