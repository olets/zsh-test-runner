# zsh-test-runner (ztr) ![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/olets/zsh-test-runner)

> Straight-forward tests and coverage reports for zsh

Features:

-   short and gentle learning curve
-   run one or more tests on the command line
-   run one or more tests saved in a test suite file
-   skip tests
-   optionally give tests descriptive names
-   optionally provide notes to tests, for example to list dependencies in the logged output
-   access cumulative failure, pass, and skip counts as shell variables
-   print coverage summaries with test count, failure count and rate, pass count and rate, and skip count

What it does not feature: its own custom semantic API. There's no "describe", "expect", etc. zsh-test-runner is not bats or ZUnit (or rspec, or cypress, orâ€¦). Tests rely on the shell's native determination of success.

## Installation

### Plugin

You can install zsh-test-runner with a zsh plugin manager. Each has its own way of doing things. See your package manager's documentation or the [zsh plugin manager plugin installation procedures gist](https://gist.github.com/olets/06009589d7887617e061481e22cf5a4a). If you're new to zsh plugin management, at this writing zinit is a good choice for its popularity, frequent updates, and great performance.

After adding the plugin to the manager, restart zsh:

```shell
exec zsh
```

### Manual

Clone this repo and add `source path/to/ztr.zsh` to your `.zshrc` (replace `path/to/` with the correct path). Then restart zsh:

```shell
exec zsh
```

## Commands

### `clear`

Clear counts.

```shell
% ztr test true
PASS true
% ztr clear
% ztr test false
FAIL false
% ztr summary
1 test total
1 (100%) failed
0 were skipped
0 passed
```

### `skip [--quiet | -q] <arg> [<name> [<notes>]]`

Skip `<arg>`.

```shell
% ztr skip my_test
SKIP my_test
```

See [`test`](#test) for details about `--quiet`, `<name>`, and `<notes>`.

### `summary`

Pretty-print summary of counts.

```shell
% ztr test true
PASS true
% ztr test false
FAIL false
% ztr summary
2 tests total
1 (50%) failed
0 were skipped
1 (50%) passed
```

### `test [--quiet | -q] <arg> [<name> [<notes>]]`

Test `<arg>`. Pretty-print result and notes unless "quiet".

```shell
% ztr test true
PASS true
% ztr test false
FAIL false
```

If `<arg>` will error when passed to `eval`, quote it.

```shell
% ztr test [[ 1 == 1 ]]
zsh: = not found # same error you get if you run `eval [[ 1 == 1 ]]`
% ztr test '[[ 1 == 1 ]]'
PASS [[ 1 == 1 ]]
```

`<arg>` can be a value, a function, a `[ ]` or `[[ ]]` test, anything that you can pass to `eval`.

```shell
% ztr test 'test -f myfile.txt'
% ztr test '[ -f myfile.txt ]'
% ztr test '[[ -f myfile.txt ]]'
% ztr test my_function
# etc
```

Choose your quote level to control what is logged.

```shell
% my_var=1
% ztr test "[[ $my_var == 1 ]]"
PASS [[ 1 == 1 ]]
% ztr test '[[ $my_var == 1 ]]'
PASS [[ $my_var == 1 ]]
```

A passing test has a passing exit code; a failing test has a failing exit code:

```shell
% ztr test true 'passing exit code'
PASS passing exit code
% echo $?
0
% ztr test false 'failing exit code'
FAIL failing exit code
% echo $?
1
```

Save a test suite and run it from a file:

1. Prepare your test suite. Make sure to include

    ```
    source $ZTR_PATH
    ```

    before any calls to `ztr`.

    For example you might end up with

    ```shell
    % cat suite.ztr
    source $ZTR_PATH
    my_test=false

    ztr test true 'my first test'
    ztr test my_test 'my second test'
    ztr test 'my_test && true' 'my third test' 'depends on my second test'
    ztr skip my_other_test 'my other test' '@TODO build the api for this!'

    echo
    ztr summary
    ```

1. Run your test suite

    ```shell
    % zsh suite.ztr # don't miss the `zsh` here
    PASS my first test
    FAIL my second test
    FAIL my third test
    	depends on my second test
    SKIP my other test
    	@TODO build the api for this!

    4 tests total
    2 (40%) failed
    1 was skipped
    1 (20%) passed
    ```

#### `(--quiet | -q)`

Optionally silence output.

```shell
% ztr test true
PASS true
% ztr test --quiet true
% ztr test true
PASS true
```

#### `<name>`

Optionally pass a name as a second parameter.

```shell
% ztr test '[[ 1 == 1 ]]' '<name> appears instead of <arg>'
PASS <name> appears instead of <arg>
```

#### `<notes>`

Optionally pass notes as a third parameter. For example, noting dependencies can help with troubleshooting. In the output notes are indented.

```shell
% cat my_tests.ztr
# --- snip ---
ztr test my_test_10
# --- snip ---
ztr test my_test_20 my_test_20 'Dependencies: my_test_10'
# --- snip ---
ztr test my_test_30 my_test_30 'Dependencies: my_test_10'
# --- snip ---

% ./my_tests.ztr
# --- snip ---
FAIL my_test_10
# --- snip ---
FAIL my_test_20
    'Dependencies: my_test_10'
# --- snip ---
FAIL my_test_30
    'Dependencies: my_test_10'
# Ok let's see if fixing my_test_10 fixes my_test_20 and my_test_30
```

### `( --help | -h | help)`

Show the manpage.

### `( --version | -v | version )`

Print the command name and current version.

## Variables

### Counts

| Variable       | Type    | Default | Use                                         |
| -------------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| ZTR_COUNT_FAIL | integer | 0       | The number of tests which have failed       |
| ZTR_COUNT_PASS | integer | 0       | The number of tests which have passed       |
| ZTR_COUNT_SKIP | integer | 0       | The number of tests which have been skipped |

Note that "tests" in the above are not necessarily unique:

```shell
% ztr test true --quiet
% echo $ZTR_COUNT_PASS
1
% ztr test true --quiet
% echo $ZTR_COUNT_PASS
2
```

Use `ztr clear` to zero out count variables:

```shell
% ztr test true --quiet
% ztr clear
% echo $ZTR_COUNT_PASS
0
```

`ZTR_COUNT_FAIL` is a convenient way to check for 100% pass rate:

```
% (( ZTR_COUNT_FAIL )) || echo all tests pass
```

### Configuration

| Variable  | Type    | Default | Use                                                   |
| --------- | ------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| ZTR_DEBUG | integer | 0       | If non-zero, print debugging messages                 |
| ZTR_QUIET | integer | 0       | If non-zero, use quiet mode without passing `--quiet` |

### Other

| Variable | Type   | Use                                                       |
| -------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| ZTR_PATH | string | `source $ZTR_PATH` in scripts that include `ztr` commands |
